## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps CI/CD pipeline for deploying a **containerized FastAPI "Hello World" web service** using:

- **FastAPI**
- **Docker & Docker Hub**
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)**
- **Render (Cloud Hosting)**

The pipeline includes:
- Code testing with `pytest`
- Docker image build and push
- Auto-deployment via Render webhooks

## Deployment Strategy
### Branching Strategy
feature/*: For new features
stage: Deploys to staging after CI/CD validation
production: Final deployment to live production
main: Updated after production for clean feature branch base

### Pipeline Stages
Build: The Docker image is built using Dockerfile. Compiles dependencies and image‚Äîimage is built but not pushed yet.
Test: pytest is run on FastAPI endpoint /hello. If it fails, deployment stops.
Deploy: Only runs if tests pass. Docker image pushed to Docker Hub; Render auto-deploys via webhook.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates an automated, secure, and production-ready CI/CD pipeline using containerization and cloud-native tools. The architecture ensures reliable deployment across staging and production environments with test validation and no manual intervention.
